<h3> My First Website</h3>  
<p> Every page of your website is a new page. You need to optimize each page individually. Now this is a good thing, because if your business has several focuses, then you can optimize each page for a different service or product you provide. So don't try to catch all with the home page.Dedicate a separate page to each of your key phrases. After your first paragraph, you can continue to use more human friendly grammar, however, do try to use your keywords as often as you can on your pages. </p>
    
<p>Be generous with the content on your website.  Have about three paragraphs of text, containing plenty of keywords phrases, on any page clickable from the home page, or from a menu button. You can bury more detailed information further down on your website.  Remember... too few words will prevent you from being search optimized. Too many words will scare a real person from reading it at all.</p>
